# loss-stability

This repository provides the complete codebase used to analyze loss-function stability in an edge-based image-classification pipeline under severe class imbalance. The experiments compare:

- **Soft-Fβ surrogate loss (β = 2)**  
- **Weighted Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE)**  

within a controlled preprocessing framework involving grayscale conversion, median filtering, and Sobel edge extraction.

The study evaluates probability-level behavior, threshold sensitivity, F₁ performance, ROC/PR curves, and stability failure modes in an Apis–Bombus bee classification task.
